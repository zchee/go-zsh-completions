# Usage of goderive:
#   -autoname
#     	rename functions that are conflicting with other functions
#   -dedup
#     	rename functions to functions that are duplicates
#   -pluginprefix string
#     	used to override function prefixes.  The input is a comma separated list of function are prefix pairs.  For example equal=deriveEqual,copyto=copyTo,fmap=fmap,
#   -prefix string
#     	prefix of all functions (default "derive")
